I utilized HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript exclusively for this project, without relying on external libraries for CSS or server/Webpack-based library. 
Since the task didn't necessitate state Change, I opted not to use Vue or React. 
For plotting graphs, I chose the Plotly library as it is an easy-to-use framework based on d3.js. 
It builds upon the areas where D3.js lacked and adds much more performance improvements and optimization in plot rendering and maintaining the complexity of the script to a minimal and readable extent.

For Plotting graph, in python I would chose the Matplotlib library as it has active user community 
and offers optimized computation and faster rendering capabilities, further enhancing its appeal for data visualization tasks.
